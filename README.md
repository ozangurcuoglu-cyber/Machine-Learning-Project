# Predicting Road Accidents (Kaggle Competition) --> **ML_HW_3.ipynb**

A Kaggle competition project focused on predicting the likelihood of road accidents based on environmental and traffic-related data.

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation with ROC-AUC and F1 metrics
- Submission to Kaggle for leaderboard evaluation




# PNN Models Assignment-- --> **2022205111-dev-5.ipynb**

This notebook explores Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) and compares their performance with other supervised learning models.

## Highlights
- Implemented PNN using NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Compared accuracy and computational efficiency against traditional feedforward networks.
- Evaluated model performance on a benchmark dataset.
